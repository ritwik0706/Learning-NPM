Just trying to learn npm using how-to-npm : a module to learn how to module

 1. npm init : To create a package.json file
 2. how-to-npm verify : To verify if everything is working fine
 3. npm adduser :  To create your account
 4. npm whoami : To see who you're logged in as
 5. npm init --scope='username' : To tell npm about your project
 6. npm install 'modulename' : To install a module locally
 7. npm ls : To list all the dependencies used in the project and to find the name of your current package/version type
 8. npm publish :  To publish the modules and share them with the world
 9. npm view : A great way to view package details, to see what you just published, and to check if a name is already taken
10. npm version : Update your package.json file for you, and also commit the change to git
11. npm dist-tag add 'pkg@1.0.1' 'tag' : if you need to publish something, and not make it the default version of a package (for      example, if it's a security release for a legacy version, or something)
12. npm dist-tag rm 'pkg' 'tag' : To remove a dist tag
13. npm dist-tag ls : Lists all the dist tags for a package
14. npm update -g 'pkg' : This command will update all the packages listed to the latest version
15. npm install npm -g : Update the npm to its latest version
16. npm outdated : To detect if any of your dependency version is lesser than latest dependency version
17. npm rm 'pkg' : To Remove a package , similar to npm uninstall
